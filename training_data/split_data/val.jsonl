But it is over the past year that negotiations between the US and Canada effectively moved forward (under wraps) and concluded in the adoption of an additional protocol to the STCA in March 2023. Up until then, irregularly crossing the border meant the impossibility for Canadian authorities to return asylum seekers to the US: any asylum claim lodged on Canadian soil would be examined by Canadian authorities. The new protocol adopted in March 2023 expands the treaty's application to entries at unofficial border points (i.e. irregular entries such as those at Roxham Road), allowing Canada to return all asylum seekers crossing the US-Canada border to the US. Whilst this may have responded to the demands of political opponents and parts of the opinion-insofar as RCMP interceptions and claims lodged at land ports of entry plummeted further to the adoption of the protocol-it sparked vivid opposition from human rights defenders, such as the Canadian Council for Refugees and some other 130 Civil Society Organizations, which, together, wrote an open letter to the government inviting Prime Minister Trudeau to reconsider. The letter notably highlights the existence of significant differences in matters of human rights standards between the US and Canada; one supported by the Canadian Federal Court in its decision Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada. In said decision, the Court held that imprisonment upon return to the US, as well as poor detention conditions, constitute a violation of asylum seekers' dignity and increased the risk of refoulement (i.e. sending back an individual who fear persecution without scrutiny of their claim). For reference, the European Court of Human Rights had ruled in a similar manner for similar grounds in the case of asylum seekers in Belgium being returned to Greece in its 2011 case MSS v. Belgium and Greece.", "label": 0}

With a plethora of women's rights and human rights groups demanding redress for Aboriginal women since the Amnesty International's 2004 Stolen Sisters report, Kubik and Bourassa contend that two systemic factors remain constant: Two facets of the problem have been identified by Aboriginal families and nongovernment organizations, including NWAC, Amnesty International and the Canadian Alliance for International Action: the failure of police to protect Aboriginal women and girls and to investigate promptly and thoroughly when they are missing or murdered; and the disadvantaged social and economic conditions in which Aboriginal women and girls live, which makes them vulnerable to violence and unable to escape from it.", "label": 0}

It characterizes the problem as a two-step process, first identifying the sea surface type present in a given echogram via an image classification paradigm, and then locating the sea surface boundary and identifying any nearsurface bubble cloud and its vertical extent in the water column via a semantic segmentation paradigm. Several widely used DL models for both paradigms are compared on the CBASSA datset, with Inception-v3 and UNet++ standing out. The paper also proposes three learning-related strategies for the segmentation step that, used in conjunction UNet++, further improves the performance. Future work will put an emphasis on differentiating near-surface biology signals from bubbles, as these get typically discarded from biomass estimates when they co-occur with bubbles, providing more reliable biological analyses, and on testing how well our models generalize to other Arctic locations.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Two caveats are relevant for our revenue estimates. First, we do not include the revenue gain that would arise if stock options were taxed when they are granted to the employee rather than at the time of exercise. The employee can benefit from a deferral advantage, although the ex post revenue will depend on the volatility associated with the stock prices. As the existing NDP and Liberal proposals maintain taxing stock-option benefits at the time of exercise, we are solely interested in estimating revenue effects under this particular policy. 7 Second, we do not assess corporate revenue impacts for stock options issued by Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs), which would differ from the impacts on large firms. The small corporate tax rates on profits below $500,000 are less than the general rate, thereby potentially reducing the value of corporate tax savings. Further, the employee, when exercising the stock option, can defer the tax until shares are sold, thereby reducing the time value of the personal tax gain. There are no data available to us to separate CCPC from other corporate stock options or the holding periods of options and stocks. As discussed later, we can only suggest, at best, a potential revenue effect that includes the impact on CCPCs.", "label": 0}

At times, individual workers complained of racist behavior of others. One woman, for example, complained of being dismissed as \"an angry Black woman\" when she tried to express her point of view. For the most part, however, respondents' concerns related to systemic, rather than individual, racism. A number complained that their ASO provided little culturally appropriate programming, particularly regarding prevention. Respondents in several settings complained that their ASO spent a fair amount of time talking about becoming more inclusive, but ultimately failing to provide adequate programs. Efforts to respond to the needs of a racially and ethnically diverse population sometimes did not go much further than ensuring that office posters have people of color depicted on them. When talking about some of her frustrations, a staff member noted: \"If your clientele is changing, you have got to respond. You can't ask them to take off until you are ready to deal with it.\" Still, many respondents expressed concerned that race was often discussed in opposition to issues surrounding sexual identity or gender. This kind of discussion was problematic in that it fails to recognize overlapping identities, and it unhelpfully polarizes positions. For example, most men of color who sought the services of these community organizations were men who had sex with other men. Discussions which focused on either race or sexual identity failed to capture the complex needs and interests created by intersecting systems of oppression.", "label": 0}

In contrast, the DFLE was 68.6 years in 1996 for both sexes. In 2001, the HALE for males was 68.3 years compared to a life expectancy of 76.9 years. The HALE for females was 70.8 years compared to a life expectancy of 82 years. All of these quality-adjustment indicators result in a downward adjustment of life expectancy.", "label": 0}
