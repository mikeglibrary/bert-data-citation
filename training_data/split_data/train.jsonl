{"text": "Background: Overweight and obese women are known to be at increased risk of caesarean birth. This study estimates the contribution of prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) to caesarean births in Canada. Methods: We analyzed data from women in the Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey who had a singleton term live birth in 2005-2006. Adjusted odds ratios for caesarean birth across BMI and GWG groups were derived, separately for nulliparous women and parous women with and without a prior caesarean. Population attributable fractions of caesarean births associated with above normal BMI and excess GWG were calculated. Results: The overall caesarean birth rate was 25.7%. Among nulliparous and parous women without a previous caesarean birth, rates in obese women were 45.1% and 9.7% respectively, and rates in women who gained above their recommended GWG were 33.5% and 8.0% respectively. Caesarean birth was more strongly associated with BMI than with GWG. However, due to the high prevalence of excess GWG (48.8%), the proportion of caesareans associated with above normal BMI and excess GWG was similar [10.1% (95% CI: 9.9-10.2) and 10.9% (95% CI: 10.7-11.1) respectively]. Overall, one in five (20.2%, 95% CI: 20.0-20.4) caesarean births was associated with above normal BMI or excess GWG. Conclusions: Overweight and obese BMI and above recommended GWG are significantly associated with caesarean birth in singleton term pregnancies in Canada. Strategies to reduce caesarean births must include measures to prevent overweight and obese BMI prior to conception and promote recommended weight gain throughout pregnancy.", "label": 0}

Therefore, these highly central researchers can control the flow of knowledge and can influence the formation and evolution of scientific teams and research projects acting as gatekeepers. Based on these explanations, the positive relation between funding and betweenness centrality was quite expected.", "label": 0}

The aggregate modeling involved correlation of excess times with traffic conditions with the ultimate goal of predicting excess times and included an attempt to determine what number of lanes are open based on excess times. At this point, CRESTA team members described they are not currently comfortable using the data for predictive modeling. Questions from the TEAC included whether or not finer-grained (i.e. better than hourly) truck observations are needed and whether or not the capacity of the bridge plaza itself has an effect on the crossing time. Team members communicated that data can be presented at finer-grained scales than an hourly basis. Following the presentation on aggregate modeling, initial correlations between SkyComp aerial data and the geofence-derived data were presented. The differences between the two methods of collection was emphasized for all meeting participants: SkyComp data was only available for 40 minutes at a time, whereas the geofence-derived data is available all hours of the day every day. Following the presentations, input was sought from the TEAC that generated ultimately generated a discussion about the potential audience for the results of this study or future studies. Some potential clients discussed included state DOTs, infrastructure operators, and freight carriers. Homeland Security and the State Department were also identified as potential clients, even though they are not freight stakeholders, because they may be interested in top-level, border-related applications. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol was identified as a potential user but, as one TEAC member pointed out, crossing times are not a top priority for them-in fact, for other potential users, as well, overall efficiency is not necessarily the top priority.

{"text": "1. Using T1 data from the Canada Revenue Agency, we obtain the value of the stock-option deduction by income class and compute the personal income tax that is reduced by the deduction for years 2010-12. As this reflects the 50 per cent reduction in stock-option benefits, we double this amount to arrive at total stock-option benefits.2. We tracked the stock-options usage among the largest 100 companies. These companies are Canadian headquartered and represent more than 50 per cent of the market capitalization of stock listed on the TSX as of April 21, 2015.3. Data for the stock options were gathered from the annual statements for each company and were collected from SP Capital IQ. Some companies report numbers in U.S. dollars; these were converted to Canadian dollars, as reported in SP Capital IQ.4. The aggregate industry-level data were extrapolated from the sample. The sample of large 100 companies represented approximately 30 per cent of the average profits reported in the aggregate industry level in \"Financial Taxation Statistics for Enterprises\" data compiled by Statistics Canada for the year 2010-12. We used this data to \"blow up\" stock-option benefits (by a ratio of 1:3 from the sample to the universe) to reflect the stock-option data for 2013 and 2014. The value for 2015 is based on the average growth rate in stock-option benefits over the period, which is negative eight per cent.5. We have made certain assumptions while calculating the tax-revenue effects of employee stock options.a) We only take into consideration the public companies in our sample to determine corporate income tax rates and do not adjust for Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs). As stock-option deduction data for CCPCs are not available in the public domain, we provide a rough estimate based on the distribution of corporate taxable income between low-taxed and highly taxed corporate income in 2009.b) The methodology assumes that individuals benefitting from the employee-stock-option deduction and their employers would not change their behaviour if the employee-stockoption deduction were eliminated.c) The current regulatory filing rules under the System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders (SEDI) mandates that employee stock options are to be reported by the employee receiving the stock option.d) We assume that there is no linkage between granting employee stock options and the dividend policy of the company (many companies buy back shares to offset the dilution effects of issuing stock options and other share-based compensation).", "label": 1}

This increase was greater than the increase in health care expenditures over that period, although they do acknowledge that other factors can affect health status in addition to health care.

For example, she made the valuable point that often the news is given in Hindi on a Punjabi program because of the \"broadcaster's language barriers.\" She expressed that there are a limited number of broadcasters who are able to deliver news in Punjabi. She used herself as an example, stating \"I was initially hired to report news at RedFM, and I am not a Punjabi and I don't speak fluent Punjabi, but I am a trained broadcaster who could do the job well in Hindi.\" (Sekhon, Personal Interview) She informed me that RedFM's preference is for Punjabi speaking broadcasters, but because of the limited number of broadcasters who speak fluent Punjabi, they take the best person for the job.

However, some staff's limited computer skills and limited knowledge about correctional principles impeded the implementation of the program. Additional training for staff in these areas as well as on organizational skills and ethics is required. In 2019-20, staffing levels were well below the intended level. Moreover, staff's high level of commitment to their jobs led to widespread staff burnout. Despite these challenges, HAWWs had regular contact with the youth and were readily available to the youth whenever the youth needed them (day or night). In 2019-20, the combined caseloads at each site were between 10 to 13 clients, which is slightly below the targeted caseload outlined by the program delivery model. When communities (i.e., Sandy Bay, Pelican Narrows for first half of the year) had two HAWWs, the average caseload per HAWW was five to six clients, which was lower than expected.

One relevant comparison is between prices offered at retail pharmacies in Canada and the US. This is useful for comparing the prices paid by uninsured consumers in both countries. Nevertheless, a different comparison is suitable for the prices of drugs purchased by governments. Many drugs are consumed by people who are fully insured by the government. In Canada, full insurance applies to consumers in hospitals, many seniors, welfare recipients, and registered First Nations and eligible Inuit peoples. Various levels of government in Canada thus cover approximately 44% of the total cost of prescription drugs.(1) In the US, the federal government provides prescription drug coverage for veterans and some other government-insured consumers. In this case, a different comparison is appropriate. Here the reasonable comparison is between the prices paid by the governments in the two countries.

{"text": "This paper presented a simple modelling approach to produce local flood hazard maps using a moderate 5 m resolution based on JBA Risk Management's 5 m Baseline and Climate Change Flood Map Data for Canada. In using these data, we demonstrated an empirical approach to local flood hazard mapping that produces generalizable flood exposure information. The approach can model changes to flood exposure based on the flood type, climate change projections, and return periods. This is novel to flood hazard mapping because of its scalability and its ability to capture climate change and pluvial flood exposure. This is the first study that maps Vancouver's current exposure to fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flooding at a 5 m resolution based on climate change information. While other models, like First Street Foundation, FLO-2D, and Fathom, do provide physically based solutions to mapping flood exposure across large geographic areas at a fairly high resolution, no such models exist in Canada. This represents a significant gap in geographic coverage for a country that experiences a high volume of floods annually. Moreover, as the most widely used model in the Canadian insurance market, this study demonstrates the utility of the JBA model in providing comprehensive coverage for fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flooding. While certain limitations do exist -including the inability to differentiate exposure based on building type (e.g., residential versus commercial) -the approach enables local planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to pursue flood risk management strategies.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Once introduced to shallow aquatic ecosystems common carp (Cyprinus carpio) often degrade habitat, negatively impacting the native organisms that rely on these systems. Detrimental effects often observed following the introduction of carp include a reduction in water clarity as bottom sediments become disturbed and resuspended and phytoplankton blooms become more severe and frequent. This results in a reduction of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), the effects of which are felt across multiple trophic levels. We sought to limit large carp (>70 mm maximum body width) access to a culturally and biologically significant 18,500 ha freshwater coastal wetland located in Manitoba, Canada to restore pre-carp conditions which were characterized by clear water and abundant SAV. In winter 2012-2013, exclusion structures were built to limit access by large carp to Delta Marsh during the spring and summer. A monitoring program (2009-2018) compared marsh conditions before and after carp exclusion. Water clarity improved following carp exclusion, largely driven by a reduction of inorganic suspended solids (ISS) rather than phytoplankton biomass, indicating that maintaining clear water conditions might be supplemented by reductions in nutrient export from agricultural areas adjacent to the marsh. The decrease in ISS and phytoplankton varied spatially, with the greatest change observed in the westernmost area of the marsh which is more sheltered compared to the large open bays characterizing eastern areas of the marsh. SAV doubled in percent cover through the 6 years of monitoring post-carp exclusion and SAV cover and species richness in the marsh was comparable to what was present in the early 1970s when there was also partial carp exclusion. Similar to water clarity, the increase in SAV cover was most significant in sheltered areas of the marsh. Our results suggest that excluding large carp can improve water clarity, SAV cover, and SAV species richness in large freshwater wetlands, benefiting waterfowl and other species.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Overfishing has impacted marine species over the last century, with many large-bodied and long-lived species declining to critical levels. Marine conservation areas are a popular management tool to protect and recover marine species and their habitats from intensive fishing pressure and human caused marine degradation. However, many marine conservation areas are thought to have low levels of compliance from diverse fishing populations. Little research exists that quantifies recreational fisher compliance and its drivers within marine conservation areas. We used the Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) in British Columbia as a case study to investigate drivers of compliance. Our objectives were to (1) assess levels of recreational fisher RCA knowledge and compliance, (2) explore factors influencing fisher RCA knowledge and compliance, (3) quantitatively assess levels of fisher rockfish bycatch and release rates, (4) elicit fisher perceptions of RCAs, and (5) obtain fishers' suggestions for improving rockfish conservation. We conducted 325 structured dockside interviews with recreational fishers in 16 locations. Intentional noncompliance was reported by seven percent of recreational fishers, and accidental noncompliance by 16%. The main reason for noncompliance was lack of knowledge. Recreational fishers were almost uniformly unknowledgeable of RCAs and their regulations across fishing experience levels. We found that 25.5% of recreational fishers had never heard of RCAs and \u223c60% were unsure of RCA locations. However, 77% of fishers believed that rockfish conservation is necessary. The high recreational noncompliance rate in RCAs -primarily accidental fishing -is likely compromising the ability of these marine conservation areas to protect inshore rockfish. The ecological usefulness of marine conservation areas hinges upon users knowing about, and understanding, conservation area rules and regulations. We recommend managers implement a public outreach and education campaign to address the high levels of noncompliance.", "label": 0}

As our findings showed, the TSA was still connecting with tenants, which necessitated an offloading of responsibilities to the SSCs.

One of the goals of improved methods and procedures for measuring output in these sectors is to ensure comparability of national account figures across countries. In 2000, the OECD published A System of Health Accounts which proposes a comprehensive and flexible set of health accounts that can be used to meet the needs of health care policy-makers as well as enhance international comparability of health data. In 2001, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, published the Handbook of Price and Volume Measures of National Accounts. The Eurostat Handbook provides detailed definitions of output by industry, an evaluation of available data by industry, and a ranking of the preferred methods to measure output by industry. The Atkinson Report: Measurement of Government Output and Productivity for the National Accounts (2005) (known as the Atkinson Report) provides a detailed review of public service output and productivity measures in the United Kingdom. Both of these reports provide detailed sections discussing these topics as they relate specifically to the health care sector. In 2005, the University of York, in cooperation with the Atkinson Report, provided a detailed review of output and productivity measures for the United Kingdom\"s National Health Service (NHS). In addition to European agencies who have made substantial progress in this area, the OECD, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in the United States, and the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) are contributing to research on improved measures of health output and productivity. The following section will provide an overview of European guidance with regards to the measurement of health output.", "label": 0}

Many population-level responses to climate change have been shown, yet few studies have addressed the additive and/or relative impact of environmental and anthropogenic influences on seabird populations. Using a mixed model approach, we analyzed the trends in plot counts of common murres (Uria aalge) from a Low Arctic colony at Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland, across 26 years (1980-2006). We tested for associations between population change and various environmental and anthropogenic covariates: water temperature, winter North Atlantic Oscillation, hunting mortality, oil pollution, by-catch in fishing gear, and visitor disturbance. The number of murres occupying central plots decreased from 1980 to 1989 and increased from 1990 to 2006. Annual changes in the population were negatively associated with the estimated number of murres killed in the Newfoundland murre hunt and the high numbers killed in the early 1980s likely caused the observed population decline. The large number of gillnets set in Newfoundland waters during the 1980s, and associated incidence of drowning through by-catch, probably also contributed to the observed decline. Though a centennially significant cold-water perturbation in 1991 forced a regime shift in pelagic food webs, the effect of ocean climate variability on the population was not obvious. We conclude that management efforts should focus on assessing and mitigating the effects of human-induced influences and consider the potential additive effects of climate change.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Our knowledge of the winter ecology and habitat needs of Harlequin Ducks would be enhanced if we understood why they are particularly attracted to northeast Hornby Island during herring spawning. Reasons may relate to the history of spawning in that area in recent years, accessibility of spawn in relation to depth and substrate type, roosting habitat, disturbance, or competition with other marine bird species. Birds may traditionally gather at locations where spawn has been most abundant and most consistently deposited over recent years. The accessibility of spawn to Harlequin Ducks may vary among areas because of differences in substrate type or depth of spawning. The littoral substrate along northeast Hornby Island is mainly a mix of cobble and bedrock, whereas there is more sand and gravel along much of the Vancouver Island and Denman Island shorelines, where herring also spawn. Our observations in intertidal habitat suggest that spawn may weather differently on these different substrates, tending to mix in with a gravel substrate when impacted by wave action. This may reduce the accessibility of spawn to Harlequin Ducks, which feed mainly in shallow intertidal and subtidal habitat. Other seaduck species that were seen in large flocks in other areas fed in slightly deeper waters, where spawn may be less likely to be weathered by wave action. The northeast shore of Hornby Island provides some shelter from prevailing winds and wave action, but not more than other nearby areas where spawn is deposited. In fact, we have seen rafts of several thousand Harlequin Ducks riding out waves in gale-force winds along the northeast shore of Hornby Island when just around the comer were sheltered waters and abundant herring spawn.", "label": 0}

Not only was the land cover class the only set of variables that had significant relationships (p \\ 0.05) with DSi yield besides temperature and precipitation, but some land cover variables had R 2 values close to that of the precipitation variables and higher than the temperature variables. The results of the two MLR models we constructed also point towards the importance of land cover in predicting DSi yield. The VEG_ONLY model, which only tested land cover as potential parameters, is highly correlated with DSi yield (R 2 = 0.623) and model performance does not increase dramatically when other non-land cover environmental variables are included in the ALL_ENV model (R 2 = 0.883).", "label": 0}

However, the average daily difference in the net heat flux was less than 30 W/m 2 on six of the eight days considered in this study, indicating that the CERES_ECCC dataset could be used to predict the net heat flux reasonably well on a daily timescale. Future work should focus on expanding the comparison completed in this study over a larger number of freeze-up periods over multiple years. It would also be valuable to test other sources of remote or reanalysis meteorological data (e.g. ERA5) as well as weather forecasts which are available to ice modellers to see how the results compare.

This work extensively covers the three domains, articulating the \"Five Forces\" within any given industry market (power of suppliers, power of customers, barriers to entry of new competitors, threat of substitute products and services, and intraindustry rivalries) that drive a competitor in that industry to achieve a stable place in the market from which it can be successful. The book casts strategic management as adopting generic strategies consistent with the Position School of strategy development (e.g., cost leadership verses differentiation) and discusses strategic analysis and decision-making with the goal of an organization optimizing its position. The applications to NATO's acquisition restructuring at first appear to be limited, since one could consider NATO a monopolistic player in the western security marketplace; however, it is important to note that NATO faces a quasi-rival in the European Union (EU) with respect to international security. Two of Porter's Five Forces are barriers to entry of new competitors and threat of substitutes. The presence of the EU, and its aspirations, places NATO's Agency Reform efforts as perhaps closer to Porter's framework than it would be apparent on first inspection.", "label": 0}

Substantial reduction in trade barriers by China, one of the world's largest and most rapidly growing economies, is expected to have a signifcant impact, both on China itselfand on the global economy. In assessing likely impacts on trade between China and North America of China joining the WTO, a priori one might expect new opportunities for China in labor intensive activities/products, while for the United States and for Canada one might expect added export market opportunities, as China grows, in activities/products that require land, resources and capital. However, the extent to which China and its trading partners will benefit from China's increasing integration into the global economy will largely depend on the internal changes in policy and infrastructure that may be adopted by China. China has embarked on a process of economic reform, but the speed and extent to which this continues to be pursued will afect this nation's ability to capitalize on its comparative advantages and to meet new challenges that are associated with the opportunities of access to a larger market. The difficulty of forecasting such internal changes means that China continues to be a major source of uncertainty in projecting world markets and trade flows.

Analysis of 3 years of campus-wide crime data, including 9 months following installation of the CCTV system, revealed an overall increase leading up to the intervention and an overall decrease after the intervention was put in place. A closer look at specifi c crime types showed that theft from vehicles was the most frequent type of vehicle-related crime and experienced the greatest reduction.

As measurement error (ME) is commonly due solely to instrument or laboratory-analysis error in our PM data, the classical measurement error model appears appropriate for this situation as we would expect the surrogate measure to be symmetrically randomly distributed around the true value.

With the carryover of 4.9 million tonnes from the 2012-13 crop year, the unprecedented logistics task involved the movement of 81.2 million tonnes.

Then the grain was moved up to 80 km over the next autumn, winter and spring by the producer's own or hired truck either to domestic grain processors, who converted it into human food or stock feed, or as part of the dominant flow to primary elevators for export.

When the river ice breaks up in the spring, the ice water discharge from the upstream easily form ice dam or ice plug. It can block the river channels in the narrow downstream river sections and seriously affects the safety of the Yellow River channel embankment. Obviously, accurate river ice detection and change analysis for the Yellow River is very important. It can provide guidance for disaster prevention and mitigation in subsequent rivers.

The uptake of improved engine technology raises the efficiency of intermediate inputs. Third, from 1985 to 2001, the average length of hauls increased steadily over time in the United States (Apostolides, 2009). The length of haul increased because shipments traveling over 250 miles have grown faster than local and short-haul shipments (United States Department of Transportation, no date). We can expect that a similar pattern occurred in Canada and that this trend has continued since 2001. Longer truck trips increase fuel efficiency as well as other inputs such as engine oils. These improvements in efficiency of intermediate inputs due to reallocation of resources toward longer trips contribute to increasing productivity in the truck transportation sector. Canada is committed to increasing fuel efficiency in trucking and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Natural Resources Canada administers two programs geared towards improving fuel efficiency in the trucking industry.

{"text": "Data from Health Canada's 2004 survey suggest a very similar percentage, 31%, for IDU in Victoria [31]. Assuming that, for IDU who borrow, 30% of injections are with borrowed syringes, we calculated a base-case, overall borrowing probability of 8.3% (30% \u00a5 27.6%), with a range of 4.0% (30% \u00a5 13.4%) to 9.2% (30% \u00a5 30.7%). Of note, clients of the New Haven syringe exchange reported that they shared their 'works' 8.4% of the time [25].Approximately 220 000 safe injections occur each year at the Insite supervised injection facility (SIF) [3,5]. These safe injections supplant potentially risky injections outside the SIF. With the SIF in operation, the base-case number of borrowing events per IDU per year was estimated at b0 = 89.5, a modest 1.5% overall reduction compared to the value, b1 = 90.9, that would be expected if the SIF were closed.Approximately 2.8 million sterile syringes were distributed in Vancouver by Insite and by non-Insite syringe exchanges in fiscal years 2004-05 and 2006-07, and 3.4 million were distributed in 2005-06 [9]. The mean number of syringes distributed during this time-period is therefore 3.0 million. Insite accounted for approximately 50% of these syringes [9]. As noted above, a small proportion of Insite syringes (about 0.2 million per year [3,5]) were provided to people who injected at the supervised injection facility and did not subsequently enter into circulation. The remaining syringes (1.3 million = 50% \u00a5 3.0 M -0.2 M in the base-case analysis) were distributed through Insite's syringe exchange program (SEP). The analyses also took into account non-SEP sources of sterile syringes, such as pharmacy sales. The base-case analysis assumed that 15 syringes per IDU or 0.2 million entered circulation each year through nonexchange sources [30]. In the base-case analysis, the total number of non-Insite syringes that entered circulation each year was estimated at dE = 1.7 million (range = 1.5-2.0 million).Univariate sensitivity analyses and multivariate scenario analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertainty in key parameter values.

{"text": "The objective of this population-based cohort study was to investigate the association between a lifetime history of neck injury from a motor vehicle collision and the development of troublesome neck pain. The current evidence suggests that individuals with a history of neck injury in a traffic collision are more likely to experience future neck pain. However, these results may suffer from residual confounding. Therefore, there is a need to test this association in a large population-based cohort with adequate control of known confounders. We formed a cohort of 919 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults with no or mild neck pain in September 1995. At baseline, participants were asked if they ever injured their neck in a motor vehicle collision. Six and twelve months later, we asked about the presence of troublesome neck pain (grade II-IV) on the chronic pain grade questionnaire. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate the association between a lifetime history of neck injury in a motor vehicle collision and the onset of troublesome neck pain while controlling for known confounders. The follow-up rate was 73.5% (676/919) at 6 months and 63.1% (580/919) at 1 year. We found a positive association between a history of neck injury in a motor vehicle collision and the onset of troublesome neck pain after controlling for bodily pain and body mass index (adjusted HRR = 2.14; 95% CI 1.12-4.10). Our analysis suggests that a history of neck injury in a motor vehicle collision is a risk factor for developing future troublesome neck pain. The consequences of a neck injury in a motor vehicle collision can have long lasting effects and predispose individuals to experience recurrent episodes of neck pain.", "label": 0}

In particular a matrix which accounts for the attenuation from radial profile to scatter pattern could be generated if the attenuation through each path was measured. This attenuation through each path could also be estimated by measuring the attenuation straight through the target over the whole area and estimating the actual path as an average of multiple normal-incidence sample paths. This information is available through the primary image. This would not significantly increase computation time and would provide a more accurate disentanglement. Also since the boundaries of the object are known (they can easily be found by looking at the data) the scatter image program should reduce the number of beams when one beam is imaging past the boundary of the sample (and thus its scatter signal is zero). A significant performance increase on the current algorithm could be obtained by compiling the program in C or FORTRAN. Another possibility would be to maximize or minimize some other metrics (besides likelihood-estimation or sum of residuals).", "label": 0}

Experiments were carried out mid-season and on the same day for all observers in each survey region for 2008 and 2009, respectively. During these experiments, Straitwatch employees recorded their visual estimates of distance to 20 continuously visible targets, while a data recorder measured exact distances to each target using laser range finders and/or radar. Targets consisted of small floats/buoys, Styrofoam blocks, and barrels which best approximated the size of small cetaceans detected as sightings during surveys.Methods to correct error in an individual observer's visual estimation of distance followedWilliams et al.

The first step was to fit a linear regression of the form y=mx+b forced through the origin (b=0) to the paired data (y=estimated distance, x=actual distance) from the distance estimation experiments for each of the 7 observers.

However for effective disease control in human populations, which are susceptible to E. coli O157 arising from not only contaminated beef, but contaminated produce, drinking water and direct contact, it becomes apparent that a comprehensive 'One Health' initiative is probably the most suitable approach to control or eliminate the amount of pathogens that enter our environment. This approach identifies and evaluates the connections between animals, human and environmental domains. The value of this approach is demonstrated by the data from CDC which estimates that three-quarters of all new and emerging diseases are zoonotic. Presently, E. coli O157, and several other enteric pathogens found in livestock including Salmonella, and Campylobacter jejuni, found in sheep, cattle swine and poultry, and Yershinia enterocolitica found in swine contribute to the estimated 79 million people in the United States that become ill after consuming food contaminated with pathogens.", "label": 0}

{"text": "we plot the implied steady-state PR transition rates. The results suggest a nearly three-fold increase between 2006 and 2019 (7.5 to 20.0 percent), and this growth is almost entirely driven by workers with IMP permits. What is more interesting is that the difference in IMP and TFWP transitions has diverged dramatically over time, so that by 2019 IMP workers were nearly four times more likely to become PRs than migrants in the TFWP. Transition rates among TFWP permit holders have increased, from 5 to 7 percent over the full period, which likely reflects the growing share of TFWP entries outside agriculture/caregiving who are skilled, and therefore have PR pathways. But we also saw in Section 3, that agricultural workers, most of whom do not have PR pathways are comprising an increasing share of all TFWP entries (58 percent in 2019, up from 24 percent in 2008). The fact that PR transition rates have not increased more for TFWP entries presumably reflects this growth. More recently, Hou, Crossman and Picot (2020) report that when the sample is extended to include those whose first permit was a study permit, but who have once held a work permit, their estimated 10-year transition rates increase from 30 percent for the 2001 arrival cohort to 39 percent for the 2006 cohort. These rates are also higher than ours, which is consistent with permit renewals for individual foreign workers, which we ignore, attenuating our estimated rates. Indeed, our one-year retention rate increases from 47 to 62 percent between 2006 and 2019, whereas Prokopenko and Hou (2018) estimate one-year retention rates one year after arrival of 67 percent for the 2000-2004 arrival cohort and 83 percent for the 2005-2009 cohort. However, our estimates for any given year are not strictly comparable since they are based on one-year transition rates that are an average across multiple arrival cohorts with multiple years since arrival. Nonetheless, if we adjust our steady-state rates by using a constant 85-percent annual retention rate, our estimates of P(PR|TR) go from 27 percent in 2006 to about 50 percent by 2014 and change little between then and 2019.", "label": 0}

{"text": ". Among the Canadian provinces, Que \u00b4bec has been the most generous in its R&D tax incentives for many years. In 2005, provincial payments for fiscal assistance amounted to 538 million dollars. Tax incentives have the virtue of being more neutral in the type of firms and projects funded than measures of direct R&D support in the form of grants and subsidies, letting private business determine the projects and the amount of R&D. This virtue could also be seen as a weakness, in so far as it might be socially preferable to steer R&D towards projects with high spillovers. Many countries try to focus their support on small and medium-size enterprises, which are, more than big firms, plagued by the market failure of financing intangible investment in the presence of information asymmetries. As firms rely more on internal funds than on external debt and equity for financing their investments, especially R&D investments, small firms might be more financially constrained than large firms. 1  A number of studies have been done to evaluate the effectiveness of tax incentives in making firms spend more on R&D. The usual evaluation consists in checking whether there is R&D additionality, in the sense that private firms increase their R&D expenditures by more than it costs the government to support the tax incentives program. If per dollar of government support less than one dollar of additional private R&D gets spent by business, then public support partially crowds out private funding for R&D. The evaluation of the so-called ''bang for the buck'' is a rough cost-benefit analysis that generally does not take into account factors like spillovers, indirect tax returns, administration costs and the opportunity cost of spending taxable income on R&D support.", "label": 0}

This research is concerned with exploring how the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's radio services have been affected through the adoption of digital technology. In October 2019 the public broadcaster launched their latest streaming application, CBC Listen. Described as a place where \"Live Radio shows, CBC Podcasts and CBC Music Playlists live -all in one place\" (CBC, 2019c), the service is meant to merge all existing audio streaming services provided by CBC/Radio-Canada into one location. CBC Listen marks an important advancement in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's long-term goals for digital audio streaming. However, the three months in which it has operated will provide limited data to be immediately useful. This research aims to provide literature useful for future discussions of the implementation of digital technology in public radio broadcasting. As it intends on providing a basis for future discussion, this paper provides insight into the future of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's digital services based on the ongoing transformation of traditional media platforms, as well as provide context for future discussions.", "label": 0}

To estimate the disability-related discrimination complaints case, we focused on complaints that were received by the Canadian Human Rights Commission and their provincial/territorial counterparts (see Appendix for details). Registered complaints can be considered the \"tip of the iceberg\" of human rights-related issues that may arise in society. To estimate case costs, we drew on the British Columbia average human rights tribunal operating costs as a starting point (BCHRT, 2017). They estimated the total new complaint cases in 2017 at 2,273 and the total tribunal operating EDI 41,3 costs at $2,997,161 (2017 Canadian dollars). We considered two times the average per case tribunal operating costs (i.e. $4,623) as a baseline counterfactual scenario to account for the out-of-pocket costs incurred by complainants and defendants. In our counterfactual scenario, we assumed that there is equal opportunity and treatment of all persons regardless of ability and, as a result, there are no human rights issues related to discrimination against persons with disabilities. Therefore, such cases would not exist, and expenses would not be incurred by stakeholders.", "label": 0}

The noise contribution from smaller, non-AIS vessels is variable throughout the SRKW critical habitat, and is challenging to quantify. The use of 50 kHz as an acoustic marker to indicate small vessel presence represents a promising novel methodology for evaluating the impact on SRKW active range, with a focus on echolocation range loss. This approach is being explored as a means of quantifying both small vessel presence and noise contribution. Validation of the methodology is currently underway, with visual vessel surveys occurring concurrently with deployment of recorders in strategic locations.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Very high-income tax-filers receive huge tax savings on capital gains\u2026 Because high-income capital gains recipients receive more tax support for each dollar of capital gains than other Canadians, they benefit from supercharged tax savings under the partial inclusion system. Most very high-income Canadians save over 50 cents in taxes, for each dollar of capital gains they are allowed to exclude from their tax returns. This is due to the higher marginal income tax rates they pay. Excluding half of capital gains thus generates a larger tax saving. Each very high-income claimant (in the over-$250,000 income category) excluded an average of about $180,000 in capital gains (at the former 50% inclusion rate); therefore, each of them saved about $95,000 in taxes as a result of this loophole. (See appendix for methodology in estimating these tax savings.) Low-and middle-income tax-filers, in contrast, face much lower marginal tax rates, and therefore save less for each dollar of capital gains they are allowed to exclude. Capital gains recipients with total income under $25,000 receive only about 22-23 cents in taxes for each dollar of their (small) capital gains -producing average tax savings of under $500. Since high income tax-filers get far more capital gains, and they get more tax support for each dollar of capital gains, each very-high-income capital gains claimant receives 192 times more tax savings than each low-income capital gains claimant.", "label": 0}

Many hatcheries employ integrated broodstock programs, where wild-origin fish are included as broodstock and uni-or bi-directional gene flow between wild and hatchery components of the population is encouraged.

This may be incorrect if fine-scale spatial genetic structure exists. Here we investigate the population genetic consequences of such hatchery operations in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in a small river system featuring a large integrated broodstock program. We do so using 11 082 SNPs scored in wild-origin and hatchery-origin fish collected throughout the system. We found no evidence for genetic differentiation between hatchery-origin and wild-origin fish, no evidence of lowered genetic diversity in hatcheryorigin fish, and no evidence for genetic differentiation among fish sampled throughout the river system. In addition, we did not detect inbreeding. Collectively, these results are consistent with current practices meeting integrated hatchery program goals of adequately sampling the genetic diversity present in wild-origin fish, although they may slightly reduce the effective population size of the combined population.", "label": 0}

The objective of the Government's strategy is to increase the working-age population in the province and grow the economy. Given the fiscal challenges facing NB, developing a cost-effective approach to achieve these goals is vital, but evaluation is hampered by a lack of timely and accessible data. The main challenge facing NB, as well as the other Atlantic Provinces, is that new immigrants overwhelmingly choose to live in Canada's larger cities. According to a 2017 publication by the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council (APEC) only 8300 people immigrated to one of the four Atlantic Provinces in 2015 (APEC 2017). An additional challenge faced by smaller provinces like NB is that they have difficulty retaining the immigrants who do arrive.

{"text": "). As expected, irrigated areas consistently exhibited higher moisture levels than the non-irrigated areas in all fields during the irrigation season, with higher irrigation rates leading to elevated soil moisture levels. For instance, at CB20 the FA and Y100N treatments received the highest irrigation rates and predictably had the highest soil moisture levels among all the sites, sustaining levels above the lower irrigation threshold of 16% for sandy loam from early August to early September. At AS20 the PEI Department of Environment paused water withdrawal from the surface water source in August for the protection of aquatic habitat. This impacted the farm's ability to irrigate and consequently lowered soil moisture. Notably, the soil moisture readings in both 2019 and 2020 did not exhibit a substantial response to SI in the irrigated treatments, despite consistently displaying higher values than the rainfed treatment. This lack of response was attributed to the timing of the moisture readings, taken one or two days post-irrigation, the averaging of readings across a depth of 0-0.3 m, and the relatively low frequency (i.e. weekly) of readings, all contributing to subtle peaks in the data. As in 2019, soil moisture was not consistently maintained above the designated lower threshold of 16% in 2020 due to the challenges mentioned above.", "label": 0}

War and conflict continue to displace millions of people, and the structures currently in place to manage these humanitarian tragedies are not effective. While we have seen a rise in xenophobic nationalist political discourses across Europe and the United States, there is evidence that electorates could be more supportive of refugee resettlement if policies are well-perceived. Canada's engagement with LIPs represents a form of place-based policy where communities can collaborate in local refugee resettlement, as well as broader immigration settlement plans. LIPs were developed during a period of significant change in immigration and refugee policy, including the localization of responsibilities, increased multi-sectoral governance, and efforts to promote immigrant and refugee regionalization. LIPs were most fully involved in stage five of the SRRI, resettlement in Canada, which included resettlement and settlement assistance programming to meet integration needs. The definition of a successful outcome for the SRRI will vary depending on the time of assessment, but success certainly involved meeting the immediate resettlement and essential needs of refugees, including housing, health and mental health supports, language training, employment, and education. IRCC's (2016) own evaluation of the SRRI has indicated general success in this area (with some noted challenges), while also highlighting that LIPs were important to that success (IRCC 2016). However, beyond this it is crucial to note that long-term success is also about building community ownership and involvement in the welcoming of refugee families, and in this regard these three communities demonstrated success.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Since January 2020 Canadian federal immigration policy has been shaped by the need to contain the spread of COVID-19 balanced against the need to protect the economy. This paper provides a critical review of key administrative trends and immigration policy responses and their significance for different groups of migrants. Using the newly developed CERC Migration Covid-19 Immigration Policy Tracker (2022), we 1 identify key trends in policymaking and practice beginning January 2020 through August 2022, and evaluate their impact on refugee claimants and refugees, immigration detainees, economic immigrants, temporary foreign workers and international students, and family class immigrants. We find that while the federal government responded with rapid border closures for non-citizens, it immediately began to carve out exceptions for non-discretionary purposes. Ultimately, essential mobility into Canada was defined according to economically driven criteria with the pandemic sometimes used as an excuse to exclude migrants considered undesirable, particularly asylum seekers, and to achieve administrative efficiencies. We conclude that while successful in reacting swiftly to modernize its operations and meet ambitious permanent levels targets, despite the lofty rhetoric recognizing the contributions of migrant workers and refugee claimants, ad hoc policymaking did not substantially deviate from the status quo. The government failed to take advantage of opportunities to undertake systemic changes and build a more inclusive citizenship and immigration model that would better promote equity, rights, and protections for migrants and asylum seekers who continue to be made vulnerable by Canada's immigration and refugee policies.", "label": 0}

There could potentially be three reasons for this. First, refugee status claimants have a very different profile from other NPRs. They were older and more likely to have had the right to live in Canada on a temporary basis for a long time, two factors that decreased their likelihood to be missed. Second, refugee status claimants must keep contact with the Canadian government on a regular basis for the processing of their refugee claim. As a result, they may be more likely to collaborate with the government for other purposes, such as completing the census. Third, refugee claimants often come from countries where their situation was difficult, so they may be less likely to consider keeping a usual place of residence in their home country. Finally, the results observed for refugee status claimants and immigrants in the refugee category are consistent with those of the other groups of NPRs and immigrants.

One strategy described by the IOM is to reduce toxicant exposure in people who continue to use tobacco through what have been termed potential reduced-exposure products (PREPs) (Institute of Medicine 2001). PREPs were defined as products that substantially reduce exposure to one or more tobacco smoke toxicants as compared to exposures resulting from traditional tobacco products, and, that as a result, might be reasonably expected to reduce the risk of one or more specific diseases or other adverse health effects as compared to the risks associated with use of traditional tobacco products. In 2011, the IOM issued a further report (Institute of Medicine 2011) on the science needed to assess such products, which it identified as \"modified-risk tobacco products\" or MRTPs. The US FDA subsequently released draft guidelines on MRTPs (US Food and Drug Administration 2012) that lays a framework for future regulatory approval of such products. Both the IOM and FDA have cited the necessity of examining the effects of potential MRTPs on the health of individual tobacco users and the population as a whole to determine MRTPs' possible contribution to tobacco harm reduction.", "label": 0}

The uptake of improved engine technology raises the efficiency of intermediate inputs. Third, from 1985 to 2001, the average length of hauls increased steadily over time in the United States (Apostolides, 2009). The length of haul increased because shipments traveling over 250 miles have grown faster than local and short-haul shipments (United States Department of Transportation, no date). We can expect that a similar pattern occurred in Canada and that this trend has continued since 2001. Longer truck trips increase fuel efficiency as well as other inputs such as engine oils. These improvements in efficiency of intermediate inputs due to reallocation of resources toward longer trips contribute to increasing productivity in the truck transportation sector. Canada is committed to increasing fuel efficiency in trucking and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Natural Resources Canada administers two programs geared towards improving fuel efficiency in the trucking industry.

Additionally, the NWAC acknowledges the overarching theme of social inequality for Indigenous peoples, but they rely on cultural reclamation as a sort of 'silver bullet' solution to much of violence against women and girls. Both organizations oversimplify the solutions to ending violence against women and girls, while simultaneously overlooking their own role in the process of overhauling the dysfunctional systems that perpetuate racism and sexism against Indigenous women and girls. In a complex, multifaceted and interconnected world, people want simple solutions to complicated issues-real solutions to these insidious issues are apt to be filled with complexities and nuances.

This allowed us to divide children into language groups and into 1st-and 2nd-generation immigrants, instead of grouping all immigrants into one group, as is commonly done in studies with small(er) sample sizes. The large statistical power further permitted an examination of theoretically important interactions, including cross-level interactions with neighborhood characteristics -a study design feature that is methodologically necessary to advance a truly bio-ecological understanding of immigrant development, and one that can only be accomplished with large-scale databases. At the same time, the linked administrative data were not originally collected for our research purposes, resulting in important limitations. The developmental outcome measures reflect teacher ratings -and though the EDI has addressed validity questions in numerous studies (see Section 2.3), it will be important to replicate this study with other measures of children's developmental outcomes (e.g., self-ratings, mental health outcomes, academic achievement). Several of the variables used to operationalize our research constructs must be considered proxy variables -e.g., children's language background was a proxy for cultural background, and a composite of neighborhood ethnicity, home language, and mother tongue was a proxy for cultural concentration. Ideally, we would have had more direct measures of these constructs. We also had no culture-specific neighborhood information that would have allowed us to address questions regarding social cohesion and support for families within these culturally bounded communities.", "label": 0}

Our study, although not completing salmon reconstructions and offering only a relatively short time-scale analysis, provides insight into the use of growth indexes and tree ring \u03b4 15 N as proxies for historical salmon abundance. We observed that \u03b4 15 N signatures exhibit a relatively consistent decrease from large to small trees both in high and low carcass density zones allowing calibration of \u03b4 15 N in cores that extend from the cambium towards the center. Without a dbh-correction, \u03b4 15 N values tend to remain somewhat stable over time. Yet, because we detected a strongly positive relationship between tree dbh and \u03b4 15 N and subsequently used this relationship as a calibration factor, \u03b4 15 N values demonstrate a decline over time. We also found elevated isotopic signatures in the late 1940\u2032s and 1950\u2032s of several trees that are currently in low carcass zones, suggesting elevated salmon uploading at that time. This size factor has consequences for potential use and improvement of salmon abundance reconstructions (e.g.", "label": 0}
