The project \"Water Heroes\" was created for children, teachers and parents to help them to enjoy swimming and other water activities in a safe way. Objective The three year project Water Heroes was launched in 2015. Its main goals are 1) to distribute information and inspire children and young people to spend time in and around water in a safe way, 2) to create a teacher handbook including different indoor and out-door models for the teacher to carry out various activities in conjunction with different school topics, 3) to advise parents on how to support their children in learning swimming and other water related skills safely.

Additionally, building a daylight or energy model from scratch within a 3 rd party analysis program provides a clear chance to simplify geometry. This is in stark contrast to dealing with the complexity of pursuing simulation studies within a fully-developed BIM model. Given these challenges, another goal of this research included using LAR to analyze daylight conditions of \"real world\" spaces, and to determine variability associated with common BIM-oriented modeling workflows.

{"text": "Population-wide vaccination is critical for containing the COVID-19 pandemic when combined with effective testing and prevention measures. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, several companies worked tirelessly for the development of an efficient vaccine that would put an end to this pandemic. Today, a number of COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use by a number of national regulatory organizations. Vaccination campaigns have already started in several countries with different dailyvaccination rates depending on the country's vaccination capacity. Therefore, we find it timely and extremely important to conduct a study on the effect of population-wide vaccination campaigns on the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. To this end, we propose a new deterministic mathematical model to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic evolution under the effect of vaccination and vaccine efficacy. This model, referred to as SIRV, consists of a compartmental SIR (susceptible, infectious and removed) model augmented with an additional state V representing the effectively vaccinated population as well as two inputs representing the daily-vaccination rate and the vaccine efficacy. Using our SIRV model, we predict the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada and its most affected provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), for different daily vaccination rates and vaccine efficacy. Projections suggest that, without vaccination, 219, 000 lives could be lost across Canada by the end of 2021 due to COVID-19. The ongoing vaccination campaign across Canada seems to unfold relatively slowly at an average daily rate close to 1/2 vaccine per 1, 000 population. At this pace, we could be saving more than 77, 496 lives by the end of the year. Doubling the current vaccination efforts (1 vaccine per day per 1, 000 population) 1 .", "label": 0}

It may be that large firms are not very price responsive, but it may also be that our sample size is too small for large firms to yield significant coefficients. For the whole sample, however, the short-run price elasticity is significantly different from zero and lower than for the subsample of small firms. Small firms do hence seem to be somewhat more price responsive than large firms. The long-run price elasticity r is equal to -0.19 for small firms and -0.14 for the whole sample. The longrun output price elasticity is equal to 0.03 for small firms and 0.07 for large firms.

While this was a national sample, it may have yielded data not representative of the broader population of medical cannabis patients in Canada, and since this sample was drawn from patients registered with a medical cannabis company, participants may be more likely to report positive effects related to the medical use of cannabis.. Additionally, as all information regarding the use of cannabis or alcohol was self-reported and did not benefit from biological drug detection to verify substance use or non-use, this data is vulnerable to recall bias, socially desirable responding, and other biases associated with self-report retrospective surveys. In particular, since the average duration of medical cannabis use in this population at the time of the survey was 5 years (median of 3 years), self-reported estimates of substance use frequency and amounts pre-medical cannabis may be particularly vulnerable to recall bias as well as other unobserved variables and confounders that may have impacted alcohol use in the interim. However, the sensitivity analysis we conducted to compare outcomes of those who had initiated medical cannabis use within the past five years with the total study population found similar outcomes in both groups, suggesting that the time span between pre-and-post data points do not appears to have impacted the outcomes of the study.", "label": 0}

In patients taking enalapril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure), the initial microalbumin of 143mg/24h decreased to a mean of 123mg/24h but rose to 140mg/24h after 5 years. In contrast, the placebo group began with a mean microalbumin level of 123mg/24h with an increase in microalbuminuria to a mean of 310mg/24h (225). In addition, there were significant differences in kidney function which decreased by 13% in the placebo group over the 5-year follow-up, while the enalapril group remained stable.

Possible under-reporting, a report of increased odds of stimulant use in patients with sudden death compared with motor vehicle deaths, and rare deaths with the initiation of medication remain reasons for continued research in this area (class IIa, level C). \u2022 CHD patients frequently have ADHD, and can potentially benefit from ADHD therapies, including appropriately prescribed medication (class IIa, level C). \u2022 Patients with ADHD, like all pediatric patients, should undergo a careful history and physical examination that includes personal and family history details that may identify those at risk of sudden cardiac death. This should be performed by their primary care physician (class IIa, level C). \u2022 Routine ECG assessment of ADHD patients before starting medication is not supported by evidence and is not recommended (class IIa, level C). \u2022 For ADHD patients without known heart disease, the physician managing the ADHD is the appropriate individual to evaluate benefit and risk and make recommendations for medication therapy (class IIa, level C). \u2022 For ADHD patients with known heart disease who are followed by a cardiologist, the physician with expertise in ADHD likely remains the appropriate individual to evaluate benefit and risk and make recommendation for medication therapy, because there is little evidence that taking medication further increases the risk of sudden death. Discussion of treatment options with the cardiologist is appropriate, with ultimate treatment decisions being made by consensus. 'In-person' clinical review by the cardiologist specifically for ADHD risk assessment before starting treatment is generally unnecessary (class IIa, level C). \u2022 For ADHD patients with suspected heart disease or identified risk factors for sudden death, assessment by a cardiologist is recommended. This would also be the case for a non-ADHD patient (class IIa, level C). \u2022 The above points are based on the consensus of a combined group of practitioners from across Canada with expertise in sudden death, general pediatric cardiology, and the care of children and youth with ADHD. Further research is necessary before recommendations satisfying higher level of evidence criteria can be made. (class IIa, level C).", "label": 0}

However, it is possible that some of the gang-related behaviours (e.g., tagging) that the NYVRP was also expected to influence may be captured by the decrease in property crimes. Without knowing more details about the crimes in which the youth were involved, it is difficult to comment further on this trend.

{"text": "We obtained such data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada's (2010) website, which provides bimonthly composite images for the NW Atlantic coast between 39\u00b0N and 62.5\u00b0N, indicating chlorophyll-a concentration through a color scale. Each composite image results from the combination of the available data for each half month. We produced monthly values by averaging the two values given for each month (or from the only value provided for some months because of cloud or ice cover). These data revealed clear regional differences: AM and GN have relatively productive coastal waters, while AN and GC exhibit low productivity levels (Table 1).Regional differences in winter ice load are also evident. Every winter, sea ice develops extensively on the Gulf of St. Lawrence coast (Saucier et al., 2003, Scrosati andEckersley, 2007), which causes intense disturbance on rocky intertidal habitats through scouring (Bergeron and Bourget, 1986;Scrosati and Heaven, 2006). On the contrary, sea ice does not form on the sea surface on the Atlantic coast at the latitudes we surveyed. Rarely, floating sea ice from the Gulf of St. Lawrence may reach the Atlantic coast of mainland Nova Scotia and cause intertidal disturbance there (McCook and Chapman, 1997;Minchinton et al., 1997). However, the last time such an event occurred was 23 years ago (as of 2010) and it had previously occurred 26 years before 1987 (Minchinton and Scheibling, 1991). Therefore, in broad terms, GN and GC sustain high levels of intertidal disturbance every winter, while AM and AN do not.We employed a nested design, sampling 3 sites along 10 km of coastline in AM, 6 sites along 34 km in AN, 6 sites along 20 km in GN, and 6 sites along 15 km in GC. We only sampled sites that faced open waters directly, so all sites were subjected to a similar (high) degree of wave exposure. At each site, we determined recruit and adult density in 20 quadrats (10 cm\u00d7 10 cm) randomly placed at the mid-to-high intertidal zone (approximately at 2/3 of the full intertidal range above the lowwater mark). Recruits were distinguished from adults (the organisms that overwintered at least once, thus holding reproductive capacity; Pineda et al., 2006) by the large size differences between them (Fig. 2). We only counted living individuals, which showed firmly closed valves at low tide. We placed the quadrats on stable bedrock, avoiding boulder fields and tide pools. We calculated adult density by dividing the number of adult barnacles in a quadrat by quadrat area (100 cm 2 ). At the sampled elevations, barnacles are often the only macroscopic species. Since the number of recruits in a quadrat depends on the area that is available for settlement, we calculated a standardized form of recruit density. For each quadrat, we calculated the proportion of the total area that was covered by adult barnacles. To calculate standardized recruit density (hereafter simply referred to as recruit density), we divided the number of recruits counted in a quadrat by the available area for settlement, which we calculated as: \"quadrat area\u00d7 (1-proportion of quadrat covered by adults)\". By sampling in June-July, we ensured that counting was done at the end of the recruitment season. Virtually no new recruits appeared later, as indicated by site inspections. Since we collected our data on natural intertidal surfaces instead of on artificial settlement plates (e.g., Menge, 2000a), our recruit density values are realistic measures of the annual recruitment rate, unaffected by any sampling artifacts (see Bertness et al., 1992, for a criticism of using cleared surfaces to measure recruitment).We separately compared recruit and adult density among regions using a linear mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (Pinheiro and Bates, 2009). We considered \"region\" as a fixed factor because its 4 levels were selected a priori (sites were nested within the regions). We used F tests to evaluate significance. We tested the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions using normal probability plots and residuals-versus-fits plots, respectively. The assumptions were not met and data transformations did not correct the violations. Therefore, we used the raw data for the analyses but considering a conservative significance level that was 10 times lower (0.005) than the conventional level of 0.05 (Underwood, 1997). After F tests revealed significant regional differences, we compared regional means with Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) tests. We did the analyses using R software (R Development Core Team, 2010).", "label": 1}

Extending the duration of photosynthetic activity could have important consequences for the translocation of heavy metals in the phytoremediation of contaminated sites using deciduous trees like willow. In the present study, three Salix cultivars ('India,' 'SX67,' and 'Fish Creek') that were observed to maintain green leaves late into autumn were evaluated over an 11-week period extending from mid-September to mid-November on a brownfield site in Montreal, Canada. Gas exchange rates, chlorophyll fluorescence, and leaf pigments were measured weekly. A general trend of declining stomatal conductance and transpiration were observed early in the trial, followed by reductions in photosynthetic efficiency and concentrations of chl a, chl b, and carotenoids, in agreement with other studies. In particular, the cultivar 'Fish Creek' had higher rates of gas exchange and pigment concentrations than either 'SX67' or 'India,' but values for these parameters also declined more rapidly over the course of the trial. Both photoperiod and soil and air temperatures were strong drivers of changes in photosynthetic activity in all three of these cultivars according to correlation analyses. Further studies should focus on their biomass production and heavy metal accumulation capacity in light of the observed variation in photosynthetic activity stimulated by seasonal changes in light and temperature.", "label": 0}

These parameters were driven using similar steps to those used for the horizontal direction. For the vertical direction, the maximum amplitude (Aov) is identified from the vertical displacement histories due to traffic loads and is expressed as where Aov and Dmax-v are in (mm), Pv is a percentage, MF is a material factor equal to 1 and 0 for concrete and steel girders, respectively. To get the number of cycles (nAc-v) for a given amplitude Ac-v, the vertical displacement histories of the traffic demands were normalized using the computed Aov. Then, the statistical distribution of the normalized cycle amplitudes is evaluated. The distribution is of exponential type, thus, nAc-v can be estimated as where Mk-v is in (mm), W is the bridge width (m), Sext is the length of the exterior span (m), Nb is the number of bearings on a single abutment, MF is a material factor equal to 1 and 0 for concrete and steel girders, respectively. Note that [14] has parameters related to the magnitude of vertical loads (W, Sext, and Nb) and to the horizontal bearing demand (L and Nubs). This is due to the fact that both of the vertical and horizontal properties of standard elastomeric bearings are related to the bearing size. Thus, even if the bearing size selection was governed by horizontal demand, the vertical displacement will be indirectly affected.", "label": 0}

We group physical and mental disabilities together, as does Elections Canada. 7 For the two elections the average shares of the population represented by each demographic group are under 30 at 11.1 per cent, ethnic minorities at 4.7 per cent, Aboriginals at 1.6 per cent and disabled (2008 only) at 7.7 per cent. Of these three groups, only youth are more likely than the rest of the population to report exposure to Elections Canada's ads. On average in the two election years, young voters were about 35 per cent more likely to report seeing the adds (interestingly, however, this group is the only one for which we see no interaction effect in our models). This lack of variation is unsurprising given that Elections Canada aims to reach as many individuals as possible with its advertisements, rather than targeting these sociodemographic groups in particular. 8 All variables are dummies. The survey questions used in our analysis are listed in appendix II. 9 We consider these response categories because we are particularly interested in highlighting the vote share implications for the Conservative Party of Canada, as the noted \"party of the right\" in the federal party system. 10 We employ models with few variables for good reason. We are not interested in identifying the independent effect of our key variables upon turnout after controlling for a lengthy list of attitudinal factors known to be related to abstention or vote choice. Following Loewen and Blais (2006) we seek simplicity in our models in light of Clarke's (2005) argument that the inclusion of additional variables can introduce bias, even if such variables are part of the \"true\" model. We wish to study the basic relationship between the effect of exposure to Elections Canada ads or being contacted by political parties for our socio-demographic groups. Put another way, rather than attempting to establish, for example, that ethnic minorities are less likely to vote because they may have low incomes or low levels of political knowledge, we simply are interested in the effect of Elections Canada's ads upon these groups as a whole. We did consider including controls for political attentiveness to various media, as individuals who seek out information might be more likely to be exposed to Elections Canada's ads.

Otherwise, the red fescue showed a good recovery of bare ground, the next step will be to test it on a different timing planting. As an improvement over the present study, we suggest to scatter microcuttings first and wait for the emergence of willow stems before sowing the red fescue. Another element to consider is the importance of soil amendment on the establishment of willow microcuttings. Our results shown better stand density results without compost, the intact soil revealed adequate for establishing a willow plantation. To minimize the operational costs of planting, we suggested that the addition of compost is not necessary if the soil has good properties.", "label": 0}
